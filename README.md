ðŸš€ Hi, Iâ€™m Alessandro!
I am a passionate AI and Machine Learning Developer with a strong foundation in programming,
deep learning, and data analysis. My journey into AI began with my diploma in Informatics. Since
then, Iâ€™ve been dedicated to building practical skills through hands-on projects and certifications
like HarvardXâ€™s CS50 AI and IBMâ€™s Deep Learning.
Iâ€™m skilled in Python, SQL, and Java, with experience in frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras. I have
strong AI & ML knowledge, from deep neural networks to reinforcement learning, I have developed
and tested various models, including a fake news detection system. I thrive on creating efficient
solutions to complex challenges and applying cutting-edge technologies innovatively.
